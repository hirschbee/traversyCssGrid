      JSON is a format for storing and transporting data. JSON is text, and text can be transported anywhere, and read by any programming language. JavaScript Objects can be converted into JSON, and JSON can be converted back into JavaScript Objects. This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing or translations.

       It makes sense to call the list above global functions rather than global methods because the functions are called globally and not any objects. Anyway, you can also call these functions methods, since they are methods of the global object where they run. In a web browser, the global object is the browser window. Then isNaN() is actually a window method: window.isNaN().
